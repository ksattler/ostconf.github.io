OSTCtool is an application for configuring your OSTC dive computer. It allows you to read and modify settings and parameters of dive computers manufactured by heinrichs weikamp GmbH.

Using Bluetooth LE technology, you can retrieve device information, update date and time, custom text, set up your gas mixes and deco parameters as well as upgrading the firmware.

OSTCtool is compatible with recent Bluetooth-capable OSTC dive computers such as OSTC 2, OSTC plus, and OSTC TR.
